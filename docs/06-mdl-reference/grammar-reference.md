```ebnf
program
    : statement* EOF
```

$Customer.Active = false;
COMMIT $Customer;
RETURN true;
END;

CREATE MICROFLOW MyModule.CountActiveOrders () RETURNS Integer
BEGIN
DECLARE $Orders List of MyModule.Order;
$Orders = RETRIEVE MyModule.Order WHERE Active = true;

CREATE MICROFLOW MyModule.ProcessOrder ($Order: MyModule.Order) RETURNS Boolean
BEGIN
$Result = CALL MICROFLOW MyModule.ValidateOrder (Order = $Order);
IF $Result THEN
COMMIT $Order;
RETURN true;
END IF;

### oqlQuery

OQL (Object Query Language) query for retrieving data.  OQL is similar to SQL but operates on Mendix entities and supports associations, aggregations, and subqueries.

**Syntax:**

```ebnf
oqlQuery
    : selectClause fromClause? whereClause? groupByClause? havingClause?
    | orderByClause? limitOffsetClause?
    | | fromClause whereClause? groupByClause? havingClause?
    | selectClause orderByClause? limitOffsetClause?
```

**Railroad Diagram:**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    state "selectClause" as s1
    [*] --> s1
    state "fromClause?" as s2
    s1 --> s2
    state "whereClause?" as s3
    s2 --> s3
    state "groupByClause?" as s4
    s3 --> s4
    state "havingClause?" as s5
    s4 --> s5
    s5 --> [*]
    state "orderByClause?" as s6
    [*] --> s6
    state "limitOffsetClause?" as s7

    s7 --> [*]
    state "fromClause" as s8
    [*] --> s8
    state "whereClause?" as s9

    s12 --> s13
    state "limitOffsetClause?" as s14
    s13 --> s14
    s14 --> [*]
```

**Examples:**

*Simple SELECT query:*

```sql
SELECT Name, Email FROM MyModule.Customer
```

*Query with WHERE clause:*

```sql
SELECT c.Name, c.Email
FROM MyModule.Customer AS c
WHERE c.Active = true AND c.Age > 18
```

*Query with JOIN via association:*

```sql
SELECT o.OrderNumber, c.Name AS CustomerName
FROM MyModule.Order AS o
INNER JOIN o/MyModule.Order_Customer/MyModule.Customer AS c
WHERE o.Status = 'Completed'
```

*Aggregation query:*

```sql
SELECT c.Country, COUNT(*) AS CustomerCount, AVG(c.Age) AS AvgAge
FROM MyModule.Customer AS c
GROUP BY c.Country
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
ORDER BY CustomerCount DESC
```

*Subquery:*

```sql
SELECT p.Name, p.Price
FROM MyModule.Product AS p
WHERE p.Price > (SELECT AVG(p2.Price) FROM MyModule.Product AS p2)
```
